The first step of our hiring process is a small challenge which will give us an idea of your skills and capability.

We will judge by the criteria: Code maintenance, readability, separation of responsibilities and expressiveness of names. You are free to change this project in any way to deliver a production quality code.

The game.rb file is the classic tic-tac-toe. However, the code is a mess and there are several issues that can be improved such as:
- The handling of invalid entries is bad;
- Lack of interactive messages with players.

We would also like to add some new features like:
- Allow the player to choose the level of difficulty, today it is always on hard;
- Allow the choice of different game types (human vs. human, computer vs. computer and human vs. computer) to be possible.

Can you help us finish the game?

Important:
- You will have 7 days to do as much as you can. We know that time is short and very difficult to do everything. But do as much as you can;
- After completion send us a git bundle to raphael@ecoportal.co.nz
